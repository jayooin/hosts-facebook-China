You have to install this file in the location of your existing host file.


For Mac: Put the file in the Desktop, then Open a terminal, and do this command: " cp ~/Desktop/hosts /etc/  " And, it's done. pretty easy. If it's not working, try with "sudo" in front of the command. "sudo cp ~/Desktop/hosts /etc/ " That's finish and you can remove the file from your desktop if you want.


For Windows: Put the file "hosts" in the C:\ Disk (at the root). Push the windows button, type "Command" and right click the result. Select "execute/Open as Administrator" . Once there, just type  this: "copy \hosts \drivers\etc\" . That should do it. You can remove the file you put in C:\ now.

For Linux:  C'mon you know how to do it don't you ?  if not, take example on the "Mac" version.
